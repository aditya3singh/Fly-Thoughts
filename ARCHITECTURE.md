# MERN Stack Blog Application Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the MERN stack blog application, detailing the frontend, backend, and database components.

## Frontend (Client)

The frontend is a React application responsible for the user interface and user experience.

*   **Framework:** React.js
*   **UI Components:** Material-UI is used for building a consistent and responsive user interface.
*   **State Management:** Redux manages the application's state, including user authentication and blog data.
*   **API Communication:** Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the backend API.
*   **Routing:** React Router handles client-side routing, enabling navigation between different views.

## Backend (Server)

The backend is an Express.js application that provides the API for the frontend.

*   **Framework:** Express.js
*   **API:** A RESTful API with endpoints for user authentication and blog post management.
*   **Middleware:**
    *   `cors` for enabling cross-origin resource sharing.
    *   `express.json` for parsing JSON request bodies.
*   **Authentication:** User registration and login are handled with password hashing using `bcryptjs`.

## Database

The database stores the application's data, including user information and blog posts.

*   **Database:** MongoDB
*   **ODM:** Mongoose is used for object data modeling, providing a schema-based solution for interacting with the database.
*   **Connection:** The application connects to a MongoDB instance using a connection string from an environment variable.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

*   `client`: Contains the React frontend application.
*   `server`: Contains the Express.js backend application.

This separation of concerns allows for independent development and deployment of the frontend and backend.
